Fill in Ideas for Analysis Here! :)


Is it worth growing a pokemon that grows slower? Growth rate vs. Max Power for each pokemon
Do rarely seen pokemon actually perform stronger in batter? Max Power vs. encounter rate
Are certain habitats better for finding stronger pokemon? Habitats vs. Max Power average for all pokemon in habitat (we will find the strongest habitat ever!!)

Kian's Ideas:
	Is there a certain pokemon type or move type that has the highest damage attacks?
	
	does pokemon weight relate to the health points of a pokemon?
		(pearson correlation test, one population over two attributes)
	
	do first or second evolutions of a certain pokemon health/attack ratio
		(T test, two populations over the same attribute)


Logan's Ideas:
	Compare and contrast the most and possibly least common environments.
	see most common types of the two
	see which of the two contains stronger pokemon overall
	look at times of day (I know this affects ghost/dark types but maybe theres more?)
	Best berry/item's across games
