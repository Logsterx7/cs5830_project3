Is it worth growing a pokemon that grows slower? Growth rate vs. Max Power for each pokemon


Kian's Ideas:
	Is there a certain pokemon type or move type that has the highest damage attacks?
	
	does pokemon weight relate to the health points of a pokemon?
		(pearson correlation test, one population over two attributes)
	
	do first or second evolutions of a certain pokemon health/attack ratio
		(T test, two populations over the same attribute)
